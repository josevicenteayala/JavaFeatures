# Java Evolution: Features from Java 8 to 21

Welcome to the Java Evolution repository, where we document the journey of Java from version 8 through 21, covering all
the major features and changes introduced in each version. This repository aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for
developers at all levels to understand the evolution of Java, enabling them to make the most of the language's
capabilities in their projects.

## Objective

Our goal is to provide a detailed exploration of each feature introduced in Java from version 8 onwards, including
examples and explanations to help Java developers grasp the concepts and apply them in practice.

## Repository Structure

- Version Directories: The repository is organized into directories named after each Java version (e.g., Java_8, Java_9,
  etc.), containing detailed documentation and examples for the features introduced in that version.
- README Files: Each version directory includes a README.md with an overview of the key features introduced in that
  version, along with links to detailed explanations or code examples where applicable.
- Feature Documentation: Complex features have their own Markdown files or code examples within the relevant version
  directory, providing a deeper dive into their usage and benefits.

## How to Navigate

- To explore the features introduced in a specific version of Java, navigate to the corresponding version directory.
- For an overview of the features in each version, refer to the README.md files within each version directory.
- For detailed explanations and examples of specific features, look for additional Markdown files or code examples
  within the version directories.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you'd like to add examples, improve explanations, or update the
documentation for newer Java versions, your input is valuable. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines
on how to contribute effectively.

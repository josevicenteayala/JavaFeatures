###   2.1 Platform Threads
   - Definition: Traditional Java threads are known as platform threads. Each platform thread is a wrapper around an operating system (OS) thread.
   - Characteristics:
     - Heavyweight: Creating a platform thread is resource-intensive.
     - Limited Scalability: Managing thousands of platform threads can lead to performance bottlenecks due to context switching and scheduling overhead.
     - Blocking Issues: Blocking operations (like I/O) consume valuable OS threads, limiting concurrency.
###   2.2 The Need for Virtual Threads
   - Concurrency Challenges: Modern applications often require handling thousands or millions of concurrent tasks, especially in server-side applications dealing with I/O-bound operations.
   - Limitations of Non-Blocking I/O: As a workaround, developers used asynchronous or non-blocking I/O, which introduces complexity and makes code harder to read and maintain.
   - Goal: Simplify concurrency by allowing developers to write straightforward blocking code without sacrificing performance or scalability.
## 3. What Are Virtual Threads?
   - Definition: Virtual threads are lightweight threads managed by the JVM rather than the OS.
   - Key Features:
     - Lightweight: They are cheap to create and manage, allowing millions of virtual threads in a single JVM.
      - Non-Blocking Operations: Blocking a virtual thread (e.g., during I/O operations) does not block an OS thread, freeing up resources.
      - Compatibility: Virtual threads are designed to work seamlessly with existing Java code.
## 4. Benefits of Virtual Threads
###   4.1 Lightweight and Scalable Concurrency
   - Massive Parallelism: You can create millions of virtual threads without overwhelming system resources.
   - Reduced Overhead: Lower memory footprint per thread compared to platform threads.
###   4.2 Simplified Thread Management
   - Easier Concurrency Model: Write code in a sequential, blocking style without complex asynchronous patterns.
   - Maintainability: Code is more readable and maintainable, reducing bugs and development time.
###   4.3 Improved Resource Utilization
   - Efficient Scheduling: The JVM schedules virtual threads efficiently over a pool of OS threads.
   - Non-Blocking I/O Handling: I/O operations do not tie up OS threads, leading to better CPU utilization.
## 5. How Virtual Threads Work Internally
   Understanding the internal workings of virtual threads helps in appreciating their benefits and limitations.

### 5.1 Continuation-Based Architecture
- Continuations: Virtual threads are built on top of continuations, a feature that allows suspending and resuming computations.
- Execution State: When a virtual thread performs a blocking operation, its execution state is captured and stored.
- Resumption: Once the blocking operation completes, the virtual thread's execution state is resumed.
### 5.2 Scheduling and Execution
- JVM Scheduler: The JVM includes a scheduler that maps virtual threads onto a smaller pool of OS threads.
- Work-Stealing Algorithm: The scheduler uses efficient algorithms to balance the load across OS threads.
- Non-Blocking Operations: When a virtual thread blocks, the OS thread can pick up another virtual thread, maximizing resource usage.
### 5.3 Interaction with the OS
- Minimal OS Involvement: The OS is unaware of virtual threads; it only manages the underlying OS threads.
- Reduced Context Switching: Since virtual threads are managed by the JVM, context switches are cheaper compared to OS thread switches.
## 6. Using Virtual Threads in Java 21
###   6.1 Creating Virtual Threads
   Java 21 introduces new APIs for creating and managing virtual threads.

Creating a Single Virtual Thread:
```java
Thread virtualThread = Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    // Task to run in virtual thread
});
```
Alternative Syntax:
```java
Thread virtualThread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> {
    // Task to run in virtual thread
});
```
### 6.2 Virtual Thread Executors
For task-based concurrency, you can use executors that utilize virtual threads.

Creating a Virtual Thread Executor:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
```
- Usage: Submit tasks to the executor, and it will run each task in a new virtual thread.
## 6.3 Examples
Example 1: Simple Virtual Thread
```java
public class SimpleVirtualThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread virtualThread = Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Hello from virtual thread: " + Thread.currentThread());
        });
        virtualThread.join();
    }
}
```
Example 2: Virtual Threads for Concurrent Tasks
```java
public class ConcurrentVirtualThreads {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int numberOfTasks = 1000;
        List<Thread> threads = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTasks; i++) {
            Thread thread = Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
                try {
                    // Simulate a blocking operation
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                    System.out.println("Task completed by: " + Thread.currentThread());
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            });
            threads.add(thread);
        }

        // Wait for all threads to finish
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            thread.join();
        }
    }
}
```

Example 3: Using Virtual Thread Executor
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class VirtualThreadExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();

        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    // Simulate a task
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                    System.out.println("Task executed by: " + Thread.currentThread());
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    throw new RuntimeException(e);
                }
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        executor.awaitTermination(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    }
}
```
## 7. When to Use Virtual Threads
- I/O-Bound Applications: Ideal for applications with high concurrency and I/O-bound tasks, such as web servers, database clients, and network applications.
- Microservices Architecture: Services that handle numerous simultaneous requests can benefit from virtual threads.
- Simplifying Asynchronous Code: Replace complex asynchronous code with straightforward blocking code without sacrificing performance.
- High Concurrency: When you need to manage tens of thousands or millions of concurrent tasks.

## 8. When Not to Use Virtual Threads
- CPU-Bound Tasks:
  - Explanation: Virtual threads do not provide benefits for CPU-intensive tasks since the bottleneck is the CPU, not thread management.
  - Recommendation: Use traditional platform threads or parallel streams for CPU-bound workloads.
- Heavy Use of ThreadLocals:
  - Explanation: Virtual threads may reuse underlying OS threads, leading to unexpected behavior with ThreadLocal variables.
  - Recommendation: Avoid relying on ThreadLocal for storing state in virtual threads.
- Synchronized Blocks and Locks:
  - Explanation: Holding locks for extended periods can negate the benefits of virtual threads, as they may block underlying OS threads.
  - Recommendation: Minimize synchronized blocks and consider using concurrent data structures.
- Low Concurrency Applications:
  - Explanation: If your application doesn't require high levels of concurrency, the overhead of virtual threads may not provide significant benefits.
  - Recommendation: Stick with platform threads for simpler concurrency needs.
- Native Code and JNI Calls:
  - Explanation: Blocking in native code or during Java Native Interface (JNI) calls can block the underlying OS thread.
  - Recommendation: Be cautious when virtual threads interact with native libraries.

## 9. Best Practices
- Avoid ThreadLocal Variables: Pass state explicitly or use other concurrency-safe mechanisms.
- Use Executors for Task Management: Leverage virtual thread executors for managing large numbers of tasks.
- Minimize Blocking Synchronization: Use non-blocking algorithms and concurrent collections when possible.
- Monitor Resource Usage: Keep an eye on memory and CPU usage, especially when creating millions of virtual threads.
- Stay Updated: As virtual threads are a new feature, keep abreast of the latest best practices and updates from the Java community.

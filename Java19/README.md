# Java 19 Features Overview

Java 19, released in September 2022, introduced virtual threads as a preview feature.

## Key Features

### 1. Virtual Threads (Preview)

Lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the cost of creating and managing threads.

**Example:**
```java
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Hello from virtual thread");
});
```

**See Java 21 for comprehensive implementation:** `../Java21/src/main/java/com/evolution/virtualthreads/`

### 2. Structured Concurrency (Incubator)

Simplifies concurrent programming by treating concurrent tasks as a single unit of work.

**Example:**
```java
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    Future<String> user = scope.fork(() -> findUser());
    Future<Integer> order = scope.fork(() -> fetchOrder());
    
    scope.join();
    scope.throwIfFailed();
    
    // Use results
    processUserOrder(user.resultNow(), order.resultNow());
}
```

**Status:** Implementation needed

### 3. Pattern Matching for Switch (Third Preview)

Continued refinement with guard patterns.

**Example:**
```java
static String test(Object obj) {
    return switch (obj) {
        case String s when s.length() > 5 -> "Long string";
        case String s -> "Short string";
        case Integer i when i > 0 -> "Positive integer";
        case Integer i -> "Non-positive integer";
        default -> "Unknown";
    };
}
```

**Status:** Implementation needed

### 4. Foreign Function & Memory API (Preview)

Interoperating with native code.

### 5. Vector API (Fourth Incubator)

Continued development of vector operations.

### 6. Linux/RISC-V Port

JDK ported to Linux/RISC-V architecture.

## Key Concepts

**Virtual Threads:**
- Lightweight (millions can exist)
- Ideal for I/O-bound tasks
- Simplifies concurrent code
- Works with existing Thread API

**Structured Concurrency:**
- Treats related tasks as a unit
- Automatic cleanup
- Better error handling
- Improved observability

## To Be Implemented

- Structured Concurrency examples
- Pattern Matching with guards examples

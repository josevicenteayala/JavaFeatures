# Java 8 Features Overview
Welcome to the Java 8 module of the Java Evolution repository! Java 8, released in March 2014, marked a significant milestone in Java's development, introducing several powerful features that have since become integral to modern Java applications. This module aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Java 8's key features, including examples and explanations to help you understand and effectively utilize these enhancements in your projects.

## Key Features of Java 8
Java 8 introduced several major enhancements and new features:

### 1. Lambda Expressions
   Lambda expressions brought functional programming capabilities to Java, allowing for clearer and more concise code, especially when using collections. They enable you to treat functionality as a method argument or code as data.

### 2. Streams API
   The Streams API works seamlessly with lambda expressions to enable operations on collections, such as sequential or parallel map-reduce transformations, without the need for boilerplate code. It represents a significant step forward in enabling functional-style programming in Java.

### 3. Date and Time API
   Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API under the java.time package, addressing the shortcomings of the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar. This new API is immutable, thread-safe, and comprehensive, making it far superior for new development.

### 4. Default Methods
   Default methods are a new feature that allows developers to add new methods to interfaces without breaking the existing implementation of these interfaces. They help in enhancing interfaces with additional methods without affecting the classes that implement these interfaces.

### 5. Type Annotations
   Java 8 allows annotations to be used in more places than before, such as in generics, method parameters, and method return types. This feature enhances the Java annotation capability with better tools for software tools and libraries, improving the type checking process.

### 6. Optional Class
   The Optional class is introduced to avoid null checks and NullPointerExceptions. It's a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. Using Optional, developers can express optionality in a more readable and compact way, reducing the boilerplate code associated with null checks.

### 7. Nashorn JavaScript Engine
   Nashorn, a much-improved javascript engine, allows executing JavaScript code natively on the JVM. This is significant for developers looking to integrate Java with javascript or execute javascript code within Java applications.

### 8. New Tools
   Java 8 also introduced new tools and utilities such as jdeps to analyze class and package dependencies, enhancing development and debugging processes.
